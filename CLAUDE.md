# flowlathe — agent notes

Read PLAN.md first; it is the implementation plan and source of truth for architecture decisions.
This file only records things that surprised an implementing agent, so the next one doesn't
rediscover them the hard way.

## Surprises / things that aren't what you'd expect

- **TypeScript 7 exists and is `latest` on npm as of 2026-09.** It's the Go-based native-compiler
  rewrite ("tsgo"), not an incremental bump of 5.x. The monorepo deliberately pins
  `typescript@5.9.3` (the last 5.x release) instead of `latest`, because the surrounding toolchain
  (drizzle-kit, vite, vitest, tsx) was not verified against TS7's CLI/API surface and this is a
  foundational scaffold where a toolchain mismatch would be expensive to debug. Don't bump to a
  `7.x` line without deliberately re-verifying the whole toolchain.
- **No `tsc -b` project references.** `tsconfig.base.json` intentionally has no `composite`, so
  each package's `typecheck` script (`tsc --noEmit`) works standalone — `composite` and `--noEmit`
  are mutually exclusive in tsc. Cross-package imports resolve via pnpm workspace symlinks +
  `moduleResolution: "Bundler"`, not via TS project references.
- **Relative imports use an explicit `.js` extension even though the source is `.ts`/`.tsx`**
  (e.g. `import { emptyFlowGraph } from "./graph.js"`). This is standard TS practice for
  `Bundler`/`NodeNext` resolution modes — the specifier is resolved back to the `.ts`/`.tsx` file
  at compile time. It looks wrong on first read; it isn't.
- **`packages/web` never imports `@flowlathe/persistence`.** That package pulls in
  `better-sqlite3` (a native addon) and `node:crypto`; importing it from browser code would break
  the Vite bundle. Wire-format types the browser needs (e.g. flow API shapes) are either declared
  in `@flowlathe/core` (zero-I/O, isomorphic) or duplicated as plain interfaces in
  `packages/web/src/api.ts`. Don't "simplify" by importing persistence types directly into web.
- **The server serves a pre-built SPA, not a Vite dev server.** `packages/server/src/index.ts`
  points `@fastify/static` at `packages/web/dist`. For manual dev-loop work with HMR you'd run
  `vite` separately (it proxies `/api` to the fastify server per `vite.config.ts`), but the
  Playwright e2e suite always runs `vite build` then starts the fastify server against the built
  output — that's the path that has to stay green.
- **`packages/persistence/src/schema.ts` implements the full schema from PLAN.md's "Persistence
  schema" section up front**, not just the tables slice 0 touches. That schema was already fully
  specified in the plan (not something this agent designed), and SQLite/drizzle migrations make
  incremental `ALTER TABLE` additions more painful than just generating the whole thing once via
  `drizzle-kit generate`. Tables like `branches`/`snapshots` have a circular FK relationship
  (`branches.forked_from_snapshot_id → snapshots.id`, `snapshots.branch_id → branches.id`); SQLite
  is fine with this since it doesn't validate FK targets at `CREATE TABLE` time.
- **`@flowlathe/core` must stay genuinely isomorphic — no `Buffer`, no `node:*` imports,
  anywhere in it.** Workspace packages resolve to raw `.ts` source (not built `.d.ts`), so
  `tsc --noEmit` in `packages/web` pulls in *all* of core's source transitively through
  `export *`, even parts web never imports — `skipLibCheck` doesn't shield source files, only
  `.d.ts`. A `BlobStore` interface typed with `Buffer` broke `web`'s typecheck even though web
  never touches blobs. Fix: use `Uint8Array` in shared contracts (works in both environments);
  concrete Node-side implementations (`Buffer` extends `Uint8Array`) satisfy it for free.
- **Playwright is pinned to `1.54.1`** (not registry `latest`) to match the browsers already
  cached at `~/.cache/ms-playwright` on this machine — bumping the version would trigger a browser
  download.
- **A controlled MUI field bound to "whichever node is selected" needs a `key` on the currently-
  selected node's id**, not just a `value` prop. `packages/web/src/pages/Canvas.tsx`'s node
  properties panel re-renders the same `Template`/`Provider`/`Model` `TextField`s across node
  selections; without `key={selectedNode.id}` on their wrapping element, React reuses the same
  underlying `<input>` DOM node across a selection change, and a fast automated `.fill()` right
  after clicking a different node could land while the field still reflected the *previous* node's
  identity — the edit silently applied in the wrong place. Reproduced only under Playwright's fast,
  no-delay interaction, not under a human (or MCP-driven) session with natural pauses between
  actions — that gap is exactly why it went undetected in manual smoke testing.
- **An execution that throws before any node starts leaves the SSE stream (and the UI log) totally
  silent unless you explicitly emit a failure event.** The interpreter/runtime pipeline only had
  per-node events (`node_started`/`node_finished`/`node_failed`); if `runGraph` itself rejects
  before dispatching anything (e.g. a schema/template error on the very first node), nothing was
  ever emitted and the SSE connection just hung with an empty backlog forever. Fixed by adding a
  `run_failed` `RunEvent` kind that `packages/server/src/executor.ts`'s top-level `.catch()` emits
  (through the same persisted+broadcast `emit` path as node events) before marking the execution
  failed — this is also what made the property-panel bug above diagnosable at all, since the UI log
  went from silently empty to showing the actual missing-template-variable error.
- **Loop/Map bodies are a single node, not an arbitrary subgraph (v1 scope).** A body node is
  linked via `FlowNode.parentId` pointing at the Loop/Map node's id (mirrors xyflow's own
  parent/child node convention). The body's per-iteration input isn't a normal edge — it's
  synthetically injected by the interpreter (Loop: `accPortName`, Map: `itemPortName`), and the
  interpreter rewrites the body's `spec.id` to a scoped activation key
  (`` `${bodyNodeId}@${loopOrMapNodeId}:${index}` ``, via `core`'s `activationKey()`) so
  concurrent/repeated iterations don't collide in logs or in the mock-response table. **The
  compiled-script codegen mirrors this scoped-id convention by hand** (`compile-graph.ts`'s
  `emitLoopOrMap`) rather than importing `activationKey` — if that format ever changes, both
  places need updating or the parity harness's Map/Loop fixtures will silently diverge without
  either side erroring.
- **Compiled-script Router branches are exactly one node deep before converging (v1 scope gap,
  interpreter has no such limit).** `compile-graph.ts` only special-cases nodes *directly* targeted
  by a Router edge (guarding them with `if/else if` and declaring them `let ... | undefined`);
  anything further downstream in a branch is emitted as an unconditional call that will throw on
  `undefined.output` at runtime if that branch wasn't taken. The interpreter's PortSlot propagation
  has no such restriction — it handles arbitrarily long/branching chains correctly. Don't add a
  golden parity fixture with a multi-node-deep branch without extending the compiler's guard
  propagation first (a general dominator-frontier walk), or the compiled path will crash where the
  interpreter succeeds.
- **A step-mode execution must resolve the graph it steps against by the flow's CURRENT (latest-
  saved) version, not the version pinned at `step-start`.** Editing a node's template mid-debug-
  session and clicking Save creates a new `flow_versions` row; the running execution's own
  `flow_version_id` FK still points at the version active when stepping began. `GET/POST
  /api/executions/:id/step` resolves the graph via `getLatestGraphForFlowVersion` (walks
  version → flow_id → latest version), specifically so "step back, edit a prompt, step forward"
  actually picks up the edit. Node identity (ids) has to stay stable across such edits for restored
  snapshots to still line up — this only works because editing a template doesn't change node ids.
- **`pnpm exec playwright test` run from inside `playwright/` (which has no `package.json` — it's
  not a workspace package) intermittently crashes every worker with `TypeError: Cannot redefine
  property: Symbol($$jest-matchers-object)`, even at `--list`, before any test file loads.** Root
  cause not fully isolated (this machine also has a stray global `@playwright/test@1.54.2` install
  under `~/.local/share/fnm/.../lib/node_modules` that could be shadowing something via a `pnpm
  exec` resolution quirk from a non-package cwd), but the fix that reliably works is: run it from
  the repo root against the explicit config, via the locally pinned binary —
  `node_modules/.bin/playwright test --config=playwright/playwright.config.ts` — which is also
  exactly what the root `e2e` npm script does. Don't `cd playwright && pnpm exec playwright test`.
